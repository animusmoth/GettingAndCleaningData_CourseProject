Original dataset is "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0" as provided at the URL http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 

#Brief Description (as provided in the original document):

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 

#Feature Selection 

In this Dataset we show the **Calculated Average** of features described in the "Tidy_Data.txt" dataset, grouped_by "Subject" and "Activity"

There are two additional variables added:

*Subjects* is related to each of the *30 test subjects used* in the study.
*Activity Label* is related to each of the activities tested in the study.

Activities are:
WALKING
WALKING_UPSTAIRS
WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
SITTING
STANDING
LAYING

The remaining variables correspond to the average of the mean and std deviation of the readings performed in the original study.
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  

"-XYZ" is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.
